							<p> Cancer is a major challenge to human health worldwide, and, while making some progress, traditional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, often have a series of limitations and side effects (Tsimberidou et al., 2020). However, in recent years, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which is also known as the ‘living drug’, has emerged (Wu et al., 2020)</p>

However, in recent years, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which is also known as the ‘living drug’, has emerged (Wu et al., 2020)
								The majority of clinical trials using CAR-T cells are early phase studies in B cell malignancies. Trial activity increased dramatically in 2016 and continues at a rate of nearly 100 new trial registrations each year. The most common target is CD19, mostly alone, but increasingly in combination with other antigen targets.(Charrot & Hallam, 2019)

								<li>Myeloma</li>
								<p>Targeting the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in patients with
									myeloma is an area of great interest owing to promising early
									data. BCMA is expressed in nearly all cases of myeloma, and is
									not present on hematopoietic stem cells or nonhematological
									cells. Among small numbers of very heavily pretreated patients,
									overall response rates over 80% are being consistently reported in
									abstract submissions.(Charrot & Hallam, 2019)
									</p>
								<li>T cell malignancies.</li>
								<p>Developing effective CAR-T cells against T cell malignancies,
									for which chemotherapy is rarely curative, will be a huge
									challenge. Particular, unique obstacles include  unwanted CAR-T directed death of
									fellow CAR-T cells (fratricide) and of healthy T cells owing to
									shared target antigen. Among the proposed solutions CAR-NK cells appear to be gaining most traction in early phase clinical trials against both T cell malignancies and other cancers.
									</p>
								<li>Next-generation CAR-T cells</li>
								<p>There have been a variety of innovations in the technical design of CAR-T cells, in an attempt to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity in hematological malignancies, and to combat the challenges of solid cancers.
									One approach generating interest is multiple-antigen targeting, with a view to increase specificity, capture a variety of tumor clones, and reduce antigen-negative relapse.This has led to the emergence of logic gated T cells, based on the AND, OR, and NOT concepts of Boolean logic.
									The potential for further flexibility has been added with the development of adaptor-based UniCARs or ZipCARs.(Cho et al., 2018) These modular receptors allow the possibility to targetnewantigens as they emerge, and combined withnewtools for neoantigen predictionmay give us the ability to stay “1-step ahead” of evolving malignancies.
									Fourth-generation “armored” CARs utilize a variety of techniques to combat an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This includes cytokine secretion by TRUCKs (T cell redirected for universal cytokine killing), of which the best studied example secretes IL-12 on encountering target antigen, so shifting the tumor microenvironment in favor of immune-activation and tumor cell killing.(Chmielewski et al., 2011)

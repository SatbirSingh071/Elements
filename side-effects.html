										<li><h3>Cytochrome release symdrome</h3></li>
										<p>Cytokine Release Syndrome. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is cytokine release syndrome, also known as a “cytokine storm.” It is caused by a rapid, large release of cytokines (immune-stimulating molecules) into the blood from immune cells affected by immunotherapy. It typically begins within 24 to 48 hours after the infusion, but may occur up to one week after the infusion. It usually lasts for a week. Signs and symptoms of cytokine release syndrome include fever, nausea, headache, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure and difficulty breathing. Most patients have a mild reaction, but severe cytokine release syndrome can be life-threatening. A severe reaction requires intensive medical care, including the use of a ventilator, drugs to increase blood pressure, and seizure medicines.

										<li><h3>Graft versus host disease</h3></li>
										<p>Activated donor T cells used in CAR T-cell therapy can cause GVHD in patients who have undergone previous stem cell transplantation. It most commonly affects the skin (e.g., rash), gastrointestinal tract (e.g., diarrhea), and liver (e.g., hyperbilirubinemia). Although Smith and Venella said that no patients at their institution have developed GVHD after CAR T-cell therapy, usual treatment with prednisolone is contraindicated because of the effect on T-cell proliferation.

										<li><h3>Neurologic symptoms</h3></li>
										<p>CAR T cells have been found in the cerebral spinal fluid and may cause some patients to develop encephalopathy. Symptoms include confusion, hallucination, and delirium, and patients with a history of seizure activity may have seizures. Encephalopathy cannot be reversed with treatment, but it usually resolves on its own with no long-term effects. Patients at risk for seizures should receive prophylactic levetiracetam at the start of CRS until all symptoms are resolved. (Nursing Considerations for Adverse Events From CAR T-Cell Therapy, n.d.)</p>
										<li><h3>Tumor lysis syndrome</h3></li>
										<p>As leukemia cells die quickly from treatment, it can cause hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, which can lead to acute renal failure. Patients with a high tumor burden are at greater risk. Smith and Venella said that patients are treated with allopurinol and their uric acid and electrolytes are monitored daily so treatment can begin as needed. . (Nursing Considerations for Adverse Events From CAR T-Cell Therapy, n.d.)
										</p>
										<li><h3>B-cell aplasia</h3></li>
										<p>With CART-19 therapy, the T cells are engineered to kill CD19-positive cells, including healthy B cells, so patients who receive and respond to CART-19 will develop B-cell aplasia, leading to hypogammaglobulinemia. To prevent risk of infection, Smith and Venella said (https://cjon.ons.org/cjon/21/2-0/supplement/cytokine-release-syndrome-inpatient-care-side-effects-car-t-cell-therapy) that patients receive monthly IV immunoglobulin infusions to maintain an IgG level greater than 500 mg/dl for as long as B-cell aplasia persists.
